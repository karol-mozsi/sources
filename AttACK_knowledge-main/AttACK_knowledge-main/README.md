# ICS Att&CK Ontology
This repository contains ontologies for the Mitre ATT&CK Framework's ICS profile.
The ics-attAck ontology's TBox is created manually.
The instanciated ics-attAck ontology, however, is generated from the Mitre ATT&CK Framework ICS profile webpage.

The ontologies are encoded in RDF/XML.
