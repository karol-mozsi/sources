# IEC 62443 Ontology
This is the repository for IEC 62443 Ontologies developed for security analysis.
The main ontology currently consists of knowledge about IEC 62443-1-1 (Edition 1.0 2009-07), IEC 62443-2-1 (Edition 1.0 2010-11) and IEC 62443-3-3 (Edition 1.0 2013-08).
It is far from complete, so contributions are welcome.

The ontology is encoded in RDF/XML and modelled with and for OWL 2 DL.
